In the current fast paced world of AI research, where hundreds of papers are put up on arXiv daily, keeping up with the latest developments presents significant challenges. One of them being the difficulty of navigating around the arXiv web interface, where new tabs have to be constantly opened and closed just to skim through the title and the abstract. What if there was a much simpler and fun way to do just that? <br>

Inspired by WikiTok, I built PapersTok to scroll through arXiv submissions related to AI. It has LaTeX support to render math equations. It also provides the ability to bookmark papers you find interesting. I'm planning to add more features in the coming days to enhance the experience of skimming through papers.<br>
